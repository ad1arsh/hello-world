# hello-world

My name is Adarsh, and I am a masters student currently pursuing chemical engienering at the University of Cambridge. Since the entire world is jumping on the data science bandwagon I thought....No seriously though, I'm interested in digital technologies and how they can add value to chemical engineering and chemistry. AI, machine learning and deep learning are quickly gaining traction in chemistry, through cheminformatics and drug discovery whilst chemical plants are beginning to investigate process control algorithms based on neural networks, and fault analysis or predictive maintenance. Cyberphysical systems and digital twins of complex plant equipment can revolutionize maintenance, optimization and training exercises in a safer environment for operators too. As a novice, I want to explore this space, and see where I can add the most value. Without a doubt, there are exciting times ahead!
